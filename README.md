# SpMV CUDA

This program implements the sparse matrix-vector multiply (spmv) routine for CSR and ELLPACK matrix formats using CUDA. 

## Usage

The program takes three CLI arguments: `matrix`, `vector`, and `result`. `matrix` is a path to a file stored in matrix market format. `vector` is a file with one float per line except the very first line, which contains an integer for the number of lines following it (i.e. the length of the vector). `result` is a path to where the resulting vector should be stored on disk.
